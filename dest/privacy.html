            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the manner in which Datacultr Fintech Limited ., (“Datacultr”, “Company”, “we,” or “us” or “our”) our website at www.datacultr.com (the “Site”), and our mobile Application or SDK, as well as all related websites, networks, applications, and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed (collectively, together with the Site, and the mobile Application our “Service”), gather information from you on the Service, how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take to protect such information.</p>
            <p>This policy does not apply to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>•</strong> personal data you provide on a third-party site or platform, or</li>
              <li><strong>•</strong> information that cannot reasonably identify you (anonymous data and aggregate data)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Information we Collect</h2>
            <h2>User-provided Information</h2>
            <p>When you use the Service, we may collect information about you, including your name, first name and last name, email address, mailing address, mobile phone number, phone number, your date of birth, geographic area, or preferences, and we may link this information with other information about you. You may provide us with information in various ways on the Service. For example, you provide us with information when you register for an account, request for a demo, your employer registers to use the service on your devices, use the service, send us customer service-related requests, or through cookies.</p>
            <h2>Cookies and Automatically Collected Information</h2>
            <p>When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use session cookies, preference cookies and security cookies. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.</p>
            <p>We may use third party cookies on our Service as well. For instance, we may use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data. Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. Google provides some additional privacy options described at https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites regarding Google Analytics cookies.</p>
            <p>Similarly, we use Firebase, a software development kit for crash reporting, application logging, online review and statistical analysis of application logs.</p>
            <p>We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users and may be connected with other information about you.</p>
            <h2>Log files</h2>
            <p>Datacultr follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and a part of hosting services analytics. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.</p>
            <h2>Third Party Web Beacons and Third-Party Buttons</h2>
            <p>We may display third-party content on the Service, including third-party advertising. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third-party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Datacultr. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.</p>
            <h2>Information from Other Sources</h2>
            <p>We may obtain information about you from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners and advertisers.</p>
            <h2>How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We use information we collect on / through the Service in a variety of ways in providing the Service and operating our business, including the following:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>1.</strong> We use the information that we collect on the Service to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Service, to provide services and information that you request, and to respond to comments and questions and otherwise to provide support to users.</li>

              <li><strong>3.</strong> We may use your email address or other information we collect to contact you for administrative purposes such as customer service or to send communications, including updates relating to products and services offered by us and by third parties and you hereby consent to receiving such communications by agreeing to these terms.</li>
              <li><strong>4.</strong> We may use cookies and automatically collected information to: (i) personalize our Service, such as remembering information about you so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service; (ii) provide customized advertisements, content, and information; (iii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Service and third-party marketing activities; (iv) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of users, features used, and pages viewed; and (v) track your interactions, submissions, status or other activities on the Service.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The Service may contain features or links to websites and services provided by third-parties. Any information you provide on third-party sites or services is provided directly to the operators of such services and is subject to those operators’ policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Service. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party sites or services to which links or access are provided through the Service. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with information.</p>
            <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is important. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to improve the integrity and security of information that we collect and maintain as required by applicable law. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot and do not guarantee that information about you will not be accessed, viewed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
            <h2>Data Transfer</h2>
            <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction operating the Service. By providing any information, including personal information, on or to the Service, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.</p>
            <p>If you are located outside United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we may transfer the data, including Personal Data, to United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

            <p>Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to time. If we modify this Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision. In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send a message to your email address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you access the Service for the first time after such material changes are made. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of this Policy.</p>
